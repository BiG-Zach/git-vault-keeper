## 📋 COMPLETE SEO QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

### **PHASE 1: KEYWORD RESEARCH (Before Writing)**

#### ✅ Step 1: Target Low Competition Keywords
```
✓ Each article targets ONLY 1 keyword
✓ Use SEMrush, Ahrefs, or SE Ranking
✓ Look for keywords with:
  - Search volume: 500-5,000/month
  - Keyword Difficulty: <40
  - Search intent matches your service
```

**For Bradford Informed Guidance:**
- ✅ "health insurance self employed Florida" (local + specific)
- ✅ "$0 deductible PPO plans" (unique offering)
- ✅ "PPO vs HMO for families" (educational)
- ✅ "independent insurance broker near me" (local SEO)
- ❌ "health insurance" (too competitive, 368,000/month)

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Create Content Outline

**Manual Method (Recommended for Insurance):**
1. Google your target keyword (e.g., "self employed health insurance Florida")
2. Analyze top 5 ranking articles:
   - What headings do they use?
   - What questions do they answer?
   - What's their structure?
3. Scrape FAQs from "People Also Ask" section
4. Create outline using:
   - Competitor headings (for inspiration)
   - Original headings (your unique angle)
   - People Also Ask questions (at bottom)

**Example Outline for "Health Insurance Self Employed Florida":**
```
H1: Health Insurance for Self-Employed Professionals in Florida [2025]
  H2: Your Florida Self-Employed Health Insurance Options
    H3: ACA Marketplace Plans in Florida
    H3: Private Health Insurance (Off-Exchange)

```

---

### **PHASE 2: WRITING CONTENT**

#### ✅ Step 3: Write for User First, SEO Second

**Golden Rules:**
- **NO FLUFF**: Every sentence must provide value
- **Match Search Intent**: If top results are list posts, make a list post
- **Logical Order**: Most important info at the top
- **Demonstrate EEAT**: 
  - ✅ Expertise: Show you're an insurance expert
  - ✅ Experience: Share real client scenarios
  - ✅ Authoritativeness: Reference BiG partnership, dual verification
  - ✅ Trustworthiness: Transparent, honest advice

**Bradford Informed Guidance Advantage:**
```
❌ Generic: "Health insurance is important for self-employed people"
✅ Specific: "As a Florida-based broker partnering with Best Insurance Group 
   since 2020, I've helped 200+ self-employed professionals secure coverage 
   through our access to 150+ A+ rated carriers."
```

---

#### ✅ Step 4: Add Information Gain (New Content)

**Question**: What's NEW in your content that competitors don't have?

**Bradford Informed Guidance Unique Angles:**
1. **BiG Partnership Access**: Enterprise resources for individuals
2. **Dual Verification**: TrustMyProducer + NIPR transparency
3. **6-State Expertise**: FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, GA specific advice
4. **Real Client Scenarios**: Anonymized case studies
5. **$0 Deductible Specialty**: Access to unique plans
6. **Doctor Lookup Tool**: Free multi-carrier search

**Example Information Gain:**
```
"Most self-employed health insurance articles tell you to check 
Healthcare.gov. But here's what they won't tell you: Private off-exchange 
plans through independent brokers often cost 15-20% less for the same 
coverage. Through our Best Insurance Group partnership, I can access 
plans that aren't even listed on the marketplace."
```

---

#### ✅ Step 5: Grammar & Readability

**Tools:**
- Run through Grammarly (grammar/spelling)
- Run through Hemingway App (readability, target Grade 8)

**Formatting Rules:**
- ✅ One sentence per line (easier to read)
- ✅ Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- ✅ Bullet points for lists
- ✅ Bold key takeaways
- ✅ No walls of text

**Before:**
```
Self-employed health insurance in Florida can be complicated because 
there are so many options and you need to understand the tax implications 
and also make sure you're getting the right coverage for your needs while 
staying within budget and not overpaying for features you don't need.
```

**After:**
```
Self-employed health insurance in Florida has three main paths:

1. ACA Marketplace plans (with potential subsidies)
2. Private off-exchange plans (often more options)
3. Professional association coverage (if eligible)

Each has trade-offs in cost, coverage, and flexibility.
```

---

#### ✅ Step 6: Add Visual Content

**Image/Video Guidelines:**
- Every 200-300 words
- Use original images when possible
- Use Unsplash for stock (copyright-free, avoid "Unsplash+" premium)
- Create custom graphics (Canva, Figma)
- Embed relevant YouTube videos

**Bradford Informed Guidance Visuals:**
- Screenshots of plan comparison tools
- Infographics: "PPO vs HMO Comparison"
- Your professional headshot
- Office/team photos (if applicable)
- Carrier logo grids
- State maps showing coverage areas
- Cost comparison tables

**DO NOT**: Put image above introduction (people want content first)

---

#### ✅ Step 7: Format for Scannability

**Elements to Add:**
- Bullet points (easier to scan)
- Subheadings every 300-400 words
- Bold important phrases
- Line spacing between paragraphs
- Tables for comparisons
- Callout boxes for key info

**ChatGPT Prompt for Bullet Points:**
```
"Give me 5-7 bullet points on 'Benefits of $0 Deductible Plans'. 
Remove any fluff. Get straight to the point."
```

---

### **PHASE 3: OPTIMIZATION**

#### ✅ Step 8: Introduction (CRITICAL)

**Goldilocks Rule**: Max 2-3 sentences. NO FLUFF.

**Formula:**
1. Keyword in first sentence (often as rhetorical question)
2. Hook to keep reading
3. Promise of what they'll learn

**❌ AI-Generated Fluff (DELETE THIS):**
```
"In today's ever-changing healthcare landscape, navigating the complex 
world of health insurance can be a daunting task, especially for 
self-employed professionals who don't have the benefit of employer-sponsored 
coverage..."
```

**✅ Goldilocks Introduction:**
```
Finding health insurance as a self-employed professional in Florida doesn't 
have to drain your bank account. This guide shows you three proven paths to 
coverage—including off-marketplace options that can save you $200+/month.
```

**ChatGPT Prompt for Better Intros:**
```
"Write a useful introduction for this content. No fluff. Keyword in first 
sentence with rhetorical question, then include hook to keep reading. 
2-3 sentences maximum.

Keyword: [YOUR KEYWORD]
Rest of content: [PASTE ARTICLE BODY]

Extract the entities + ensure the entities are within the introduction."
```

---

#### ✅ Step 9: Check FAQs vs Google

**Process:**
1. Split screen: Your content | Google "People Also Ask"
2. Identify missing FAQs
3. Add them to bottom of article
4. Answer concisely (no fluff)

**ChatGPT Prompt for FAQ Answers:**
```
"Answer this in short format. Cut out any fluff. Get straight to the point:
[FAQ QUESTION]"
```

**Example for Self-Employed Article:**
- ✅ "Can I deduct health insurance if self-employed?"
- ✅ "How much does self-employed health insurance cost in Florida?"
- ✅ "Do I qualify for premium tax credits if self-employed?"
- ✅ "Can I use HSA if self-employed?"

---

#### ✅ Step 10: Internal & External Links

**Requirements:**
- 2-3 internal links (to your own pages)
- 2-3 external links (to authority sites)
- Links must be RELEVANT and USEFUL

**Bradford Informed Guidance Internal Links:**
- Quote request page
- Carriers page
- Doctor lookup tool
- State-specific pages (e.g., Florida health insurance)
- Related blog posts

**External Authority Links:**
- Healthcare.gov (official)
- IRS.gov (tax information)
- NAIC.org (insurance regulatory)
- State insurance department sites

**How to Find Internal Links:**
```
1. Type your keyword in your site search
2. Find 2-3 relevant articles
3. Link using natural anchor text
4. Links must add value for reader
```

---

#### ✅ Step 11: Fact Checking (CRITICAL for Insurance)

**Why This Matters:**
- AI hallucinates statistics
- Insurance regulations change frequently
- Incorrect tax info = legal liability
- Client trust depends on accuracy

**Fact Check These Elements:**
- ✅ Tax deduction limits (verify current IRS rules)
- ✅ State-specific regulations (check state insurance dept)
- ✅ Carrier availability (confirm carriers still offer plans)
- ✅ Premium estimates (use real 2025 data)
- ✅ Enrollment deadlines (verify current dates)

**Tools:**
- Originality.ai (has fact checker)
- Manual verification (official sources)
- Cross-reference multiple sources

---

#### ✅ Step 12: Reduce AI Detection Score

**Why This Matters:**
- Google's spam detector flags obvious AI content
- "Low effort" content = ranking penalty
- Multiple case studies prove impact

**Tool**: Originality.ai

**Process:**
1. Run article through Originality.ai
2. If AI detection >50%, manually rewrite sections
3. Add personal anecdotes and experiences
4. Use conversational language
5. Include first-hand observations

**Bradford Informed Guidance Personal Touch:**
```
❌ AI: "Self-employed health insurance offers several benefits including..."
✅ Human: "Last month, a freelance designer came to me paying $850/month 
         for an HMO. We found her a PPO with better coverage for $620/month 
         through our BiG partnership. That's $2,760 in annual savings."
```

---

#### ✅ Step 13: Keyword Optimization

**On-Page SEO Checklist:**
- ✅ Keyword in URL slug (e.g., `/blog/self-employed-health-insurance-florida`)
- ✅ Keyword in page title (H1)
- ✅ Keyword in first 100 words
- ✅ Keyword in at least one H2 heading
- ✅ Keyword in meta description
- ✅ Keyword in image alt text (1-2 images)
- ✅ LSI keywords naturally throughout (don't keyword stuff)

**Title Tag Formula:**
```
[Keyword]: [Benefit/Number] | [Brand]
```

**Examples:**
- "Self-Employed Health Insurance Florida: 2025 Guide | Bradford Informed Guidance"
- "PPO vs. HMO: Which is Right for You? [2025 Comparison] | Bradford"
- "$0 Deductible Health Plans: Complete Guide | BiG Partnership Access"

#### ✅ Step 15: Add First-Hand Experience

**This is CRITICAL for EEAT.**

**Insert Throughout Article:**
- Client success stories (anonymized)
- Personal observations from your work
- State-specific insights you've learned
- Common mistakes you've seen
- Unique situations you've handled

**Example Insertions:**
```
"In my 8 years as a Florida broker, the biggest mistake I see self-employed 
professionals make is choosing plans based only on premium cost. Last year, 
a client saved $100/month on premiums but ended up paying $3,000 more in 
out-of-pocket costs because they didn't check the prescription drug coverage."
```

---

#### ✅ Step 16: CTAs & Funnel Links

**Strategic CTA Placement:**
- After introduction (soft CTA)
- Middle of article (medium CTA)
- End of article (strong CTA)
- Within relevant sections (contextual CTAs)

**CTA Types:**

**Soft CTA (Early Article):**
```
"Want to see actual plan comparisons for your situation? 
[Use our free quote tool] to compare options from 150+ carriers."
```

**Medium CTA (Middle):**
```
"Not sure which plan type is right for you? 
[Schedule a free consultation] with our licensed brokers."
```

**Strong CTA (End):**
```
"Ready to get coverage that fits your budget and needs? 
[Get personalized quotes] from our Best Insurance Group partnership. 
Access to 150+ A+ rated carriers with personal, local guidance."
```

**Contextual CTA (Within Content):**
```
"Before choosing a plan, verify your doctors are in-network using our 
[free doctor lookup tool] that checks multiple carriers at once."
```
