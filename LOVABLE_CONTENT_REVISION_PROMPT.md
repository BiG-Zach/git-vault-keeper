# üéØ MASTER PROMPT: Homepage Content Professionalization

## PROJECT CONTEXT
Bradford Informed Guidance is a licensed insurance brokerage. The homepage currently uses conversational, marketing-heavy language that undermines professional credibility. This comprehensive revision elevates all copy to industry-standard professional tone while reducing word count by 50% and eliminating legally problematic language.

---

## üö® CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Technical Guardrails
- **NEVER modify**: Desktop layouts (‚â•768px), routing, API endpoints, env vars, analytics, Tailwind config
- **Mobile CSS Rule**: All mobile CSS in `src/mobile/*.module.css` with `@media (max-width: 767.98px)`
- **Component Safety**: Only edit TEXT CONTENT within existing JSX structure
- **No Structural Changes**: Preserve all className attributes, component hierarchy, imports, props
- **Fail-Closed**: If uncertain about a change, skip it and document

### Legal Requirements
- **REMOVE ALL PERSONAL GUARANTEES**: No "I guarantee," "my promise," "money back" language
- **REMOVE FIRST-PERSON**: No "I," "my," "me" - use institutional voice only
- **VERIFY STATISTICS**: All numerical claims must be marked with `{/* VERIFY STAT */}` comment if not documented
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Only mention states where licensed (FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, GA)

---

## üìã CONTENT REVISION SPECIFICATIONS

### Tone & Style Guidelines

#### ‚ùå ELIMINATE
- Emotional appeals: "truly," "really," "deserve," "peace of mind"
- Defensive language: "no hidden fees," "no pressure," "no obligation"
- Imperatives: "Stop overpaying," "Get your quote now," "Start today"
- Over-qualification: "completely free," "absolutely," "totally"
- First-person informal: "I'll help you," "my guarantee"
- Marketing clich√©s: "moves with you," "smarter insurance"
- Dramatic punctuation: "Period." at end of sentences

#### ‚úÖ ADOPT
- Declarative professional tone
- Third-person institutional voice ("Licensed professionals provide...")
- Specific, verifiable claims only
- Professional insurance terminology
- Credential-forward positioning
- Parallel sentence structures
- Active voice with institutional subject
