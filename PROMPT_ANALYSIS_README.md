- [ ] Node dependencies installed: `npm install`
- [ ] Dev server can start: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Git branch is correct (main or genspark_ai_developer)

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'MultimediaOverview'"
**Solution:** Create the component first:
```bash
touch src/components/blog/MultimediaOverview.tsx
# Then add component code
```

### Issue: "Files not found in AI Drive"
**Solution:** Upload files to `/mnt/aidrive/` first:
```bash
# Files should be at:
/mnt/aidrive/The_Financial_Protection_Paradox__Record_Premiums,_100_Million_.m4a
/mnt/aidrive/Demystifying_Life_Insurance.mp4
```

### Issue: "Type errors in article component"
**Solution:** Ensure imports are correct:
```tsx
import MultimediaOverview from '../../components/blog/MultimediaOverview';
import { generateFAQSchema } from '../../utils/faqSchema';
```

### Issue: "Assets 404 in browser"
**Solution:** Verify asset paths:
```tsx
// Should be:
<source src="/media/audio/file.m4a" type="audio/mp4" />
// NOT:
<source src="/assets/audio/file.m4a" type="audio/mp4" />
```
