## üéØ WHAT YOU'RE FIXING

### The Problem:
- Homepage shows "since **2019**" 
- Desktop hero shows "since **2019**"
- About page shows "since **2020**" ‚Üê Correct!

### The Solution:
Update Homepage + Desktop hero to match About page ‚Üí **"since 2020"**

### Why This Matters:
- User directive: "we've been partnering since 2020 not 2019 for the 5 year partnership"
- Inconsistent dates erode trust
- Must be accurate before adding more features

1. Select OLD_CODE from implementation guide
2. Use Codex to find exact match in file
3. Apply NEW_CODE replacement
4. Verify change in diff view
5. Save and move to next change

**Time-Saving Trick**:
Both changes are identical (2019‚Üí2020), so you can apply the same pattern twice!

## üìû NEED HELP?

### Common Issues:

**Q: Can't find line 117 in Home.tsx?**  
A: Line numbers are approximate. Search for: `Partnering with Best Insurance Group since`

**Q: Codex says "no match found"?**  
A: Copy OLD_CODE exactly as shown (including whitespace/indentation)

**Q: Should I create a new branch?**  
A: Use existing `feature/nipr-dual-verification` branch for now (or create `fix/brand-consistency-2020`)
