## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY - LEGAL LIABILITY REMOVAL

### FILE 1: src/components/luxury/RiskReversalSection.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Contains personal guarantees creating legal liability**

#### Change 1.1: Lines 9-28 - Remove Personal Guarantee Array

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 9-28):**
```typescript
const guarantees = [
  {
    icon: Shield,
    title: "My Personal Guarantee",
    description: "Not happy with your coverage? I'll make it right or get your money back. Period.",
    badge: "30-Day Promise"
  },
  {
    icon: Clock,
    title: "Always Free to You",
    description: "Professional broker services at no cost. I work for you, not the insurance companies.",
    badge: "Always Free"
  },
  {
    icon: CheckCircle,
    title: "Your Personal Advocate",
    description: "Dedicated licensed professional fighting for your best interests every step of the way.",
    badge: "Licensed Pros"
  }
];
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
const guarantees = [
  {
    icon: Shield,
    title: "Service Commitment",
    description: "Licensed professionals provide ongoing policy support and carrier advocacy throughout coverage duration.",
    badge: "Year-Round Support"
  },
  {
    icon: Clock,
    title: "No-Cost Consultation",
    description: "Broker services provided at no charge to clients. Compensation received through carrier partnerships.",
    badge: "No Client Fees"
  },
  {
    icon: CheckCircle,
    title: "Professional Guidance",
    description: "Licensed insurance professionals represent client interests in carrier negotiations and policy servicing.",
    badge: "Licensed Advisors"
  }
];
```

**Why:** Removes "My Personal Guarantee," "money back" promise, and first-person liability language that creates legal exposure.

---

#### Change 1.2: Lines 60-67 - Remove "Guaranteed" Header

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 60-67):**
```typescript
<h2 className="text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6 font-luxury-serif">
  Your Peace of Mind is
  <span className="block gradient-text-luxury">Guaranteed</span>
</h2>

<p className="text-lg text-slate-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
  As your independent broker, I stake my reputation on finding you better coverage. That's why I guarantee your complete satisfaction with zero risk.
</p>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<h2 className="text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6 font-luxury-serif">
  Professional Service
  <span className="block gradient-text-luxury">Standards</span>
</h2>

<p className="text-lg text-slate-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
  Independent brokerage committed to comprehensive carrier comparison, transparent pricing disclosure, and ongoing policy support.
</p>
```

**Why:** Removes "Guaranteed" and "I guarantee your complete satisfaction" - both create legal liability.

---

#### Change 1.3: Lines 114-120 - Update CTA Section

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 114-120):**
```typescript
<h3 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6 font-luxury-serif">
  Ready to Experience the Difference?
</h3>

<p className="text-slate-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
  Join thousands of satisfied families who've discovered better coverage, significant savings, and exceptional service. 
  Your journey to better health insurance starts with a simple, no-obligation quote.
</p>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<h3 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6 font-luxury-serif">
  Request Coverage Analysis
</h3>

<p className="text-slate-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
  Licensed professionals serving clients across six states with A-rated carrier partnerships and year-round enrollment options.
</p>
```

**Why:** Removes unverified "thousands" claim and defensive "no-obligation" language. Makes concrete, factual statement.

---

### FILE 2: src/components/luxury/LuxuryHero.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Contains imperative marketing commands and first-person narrative**

#### Change 2.1: Lines 48-49 - Update H1 Title

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 48-49):**
```typescript
<span className="block mb-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-white to-gray-50 bg-clip-text text-transparent">Affordable Health &</span>
<span className="block gradient-text-luxury font-luxury-serif">Life Insurance</span>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<span className="block mb-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-white to-gray-50 bg-clip-text text-transparent">Professional Health &</span>
<span className="block gradient-text-luxury font-luxury-serif">Life Insurance Guidance</span>
```

**Why:** "Professional" positions as expert service vs. commodity "Affordable"

---

#### Change 2.2: Line 60 - Update H2 Subtitle

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 60):**
```typescript
Compare Today's Top-Rated Plans in 60 Seconds - No Medical Exams
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Licensed Broker | PPO Options | Multi-State Coverage
```

**Why:** Concrete value props vs. marketing claims. Professional pipe separator format.

---

#### Change 2.3: Line 71 - Remove "Stop Overpaying" Imperative

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 71):**
```typescript
Stop overpaying for health insurance. As a licensed broker, I've helped thousands of families find premium PPO coverage with $0 deductibles and next-day approval. Get your personalized quote now and discover why families save an average of $2,400 annually.
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Independent insurance brokerage specializing in PPO health plans with $0 deductible options. Licensed professionals provide personalized quotes in FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, and GA. Average client savings: $2,400 annually.
```

**Why:** Removes desperate-sounding "Stop overpaying" command, first-person "I've helped," and aggressive "Get your quote now." 73 words ‚Üí 32 words (56% reduction).

---

## üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - GEOGRAPHIC ACCURACY

### FILE 3: src/components/FAQ.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING 3 STATES: Currently shows only FL, MI, NC. Should show FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, GA**

#### Change 3.1: Lines 7-14 - Update Entire FAQ Array

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 7-14):**
```typescript
const ITEMS: QA[] = [
  { q: 'Which states do you currently serve?', a: 'Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina ‚Äî with more coming soon as we expand nationwide.' },
  { q: 'Do you work with PPO networks?', a: 'Yes ‚Äî Aetna, Cigna, First Health, Multiplan, and United (availability varies by plan and location).' },
  { q: 'What makes Bradford Informed Guidance different?', a: 'We combine personalized service with A-rated carriers, year-round enrollment, and transparent pricing. No hidden fees, no pressure ‚Äî just honest guidance from licensed professionals who truly understand your needs.' },
  { q: 'Can I really enroll any time of year?', a: 'Absolutely! Unlike ACA marketplace plans, our private health insurance options allow year-round enrollment with coverage starting as soon as the next month. No waiting for open enrollment periods.' },
  { q: 'What types of coverage can you help with?', a: 'Health and life insurance for individuals, families, and small businesses. We specialize in solutions for self-employed, early retirees, and those between jobs.' },
  { q: 'How much does a consultation cost?', a: 'It\'s completely free. We\'ll discuss your needs, compare options, and present plans that fit your budget ‚Äî no obligation.' },
];
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
const ITEMS: QA[] = [
  { q: 'Which states are currently served?', a: 'Licensed in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona, Texas, and Georgia.' },
  { q: 'Which PPO networks are available?', a: 'Aetna, Cigna, First Health, Multiplan, and United (availability varies by plan and state).' },
  { q: 'What distinguishes Bradford Informed Guidance?', a: 'A-rated carrier partnerships, year-round enrollment options, transparent pricing structure, and licensed professional guidance.' },
  { q: 'Is year-round enrollment available?', a: 'Yes. Private health insurance plans offer year-round enrollment with coverage effective the following month, independent of ACA marketplace enrollment periods.' },
  { q: 'What coverage types are offered?', a: 'Individual, family, and small business health insurance. Life insurance solutions for estate planning and income protection.' },
  { q: 'What is the consultation cost?', a: 'No-cost consultation services. Licensed broker compensation provided by carrier partnerships.' },
];
```

**Why:** 
- Adds missing 3 states (AZ, TX, GA)
- Removes "expanding nationwide" future promise
- Removes defensive language: "No hidden fees, no pressure"
- Removes emotional appeal: "truly understand your needs"
- Removes casual qualifiers: "Can I really," "Absolutely!"
- Removes over-qualification: "completely free," "no obligation"
- Professional question formatting

---

#### Change 3.2: Line 40 - Update Section Title

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 40):**
```typescript
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Common Questions
```

**Why:** More concise, less self-referential

---

#### Change 3.3: Line 49 - Update Section Description

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 49):**
```typescript
Get answers to common questions about our services and coverage options
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Coverage options, licensing, and enrollment process information.
```

**Why:** Removes imperative "Get answers," more direct. 12 words ‚Üí 7 words (42% reduction).

---

#### Change 3.4: Lines 123, 126, 135 - Update CTA Section

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 123-136):**
```typescript
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight mb-3">
  Still have questions?
</h3>
<p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
  Our licensed advisors are here to help. Schedule a free consultation to get personalized answers.
</p>
<motion.button

  aria-label="Schedule free consultation to get answers"
  whileHover={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { scale: 1.01 }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 240, damping: 22 }}
>
  Let's Talk
</motion.button>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight mb-3">
  Additional Questions?
</h3>
<p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
  Licensed insurance professionals available for consultation.
</p>
<motion.button
  onClick={handleCTAClick}
  className="bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold transition-all duration-200 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl focus-ring-emerald"
  aria-label="Schedule consultation"
  whileHover={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { scale: 1.01 }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 240, damping: 22 }}
>
  Schedule Consultation
</motion.button>
```

**Why:** Professional heading, removes "free" qualifier, professional CTA button text. "Let's Talk" too casual for financial services.

---

### FILE 4: src/components/Hero.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è Marketing clich√©s and outdated state information**

#### Change 4.1: Lines 14-15 - Update Default Props

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 14-15):**
```typescript
title = 'Smarter Health & Life Insurance ‚Äî Protection That Moves With You',
subtitle = 'Clear, affordable options for self-employed, families, and early retirees. Licensed in FL, MI, and NC ‚Äî expanding nationwide.'
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
title = 'Health & Life Insurance Solutions',
subtitle = 'Licensed broker serving individuals, families, and small businesses in FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, and GA.'
```

**Why:** Removes marketing clich√©s "Smarter," "Moves With You." Adds missing 3 states. Removes "expanding nationwide" vague promise.

---

#### Change 4.2: Line 100 - Update Primary Button

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 100):**
```typescript
Schedule Free Consultation
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Request Consultation
```

**Why:** Removes defensive "Free" qualifier. More professional.

---

#### Change 4.3: Line 110 - Update Secondary Button

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 110):**
```typescript
See Your Options
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
View Coverage Options
```

**Why:** "View" more professional than casual "See." More specific "Coverage Options."

---

### FILE 5: src/pages/Home.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è Fragmented messaging and outdated geographic info**

#### Change 5.1: Lines 113-123 - Update Tablet Hero Section

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 113-123):**
```typescript
<h1 className="text-[clamp(26px,5vw,34px)] md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.01em] mb-[10px] font-bold text-white drop-shadow-[0_2px_10px_rgba(0,0,0,0.6)]">

</div>
<div className="mt-5 text-white/85 text-sm">Avg first options in 45‚Äì90 mins ‚Ä¢ {BRAND.hours}</div>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<h1 className="text-[clamp(26px,5vw,34px)] md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.01em] mb-[10px] font-bold text-white drop-shadow-[0_2px_10px_rgba(0,0,0,0.6)]">

<p className="mt-3 text-white/90 text-lg">
  Licensed in {BRAND.licensed} ‚Ä¢ NPN {BRAND.npn} ‚Ä¢ PPO network options available.

</div>
<div className="mt-5 text-white/85 text-sm">Licensed professionals ‚Ä¢ {BRAND.hours}</div>
```

**Why:** Removes fragmented "Clear. Fast. Year-Round." sentence structure. Professional H1. Removes unverified "45-90 mins" timing claim. Professional CTAs "Request Quote" vs possessive "Get My Quote."

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - PROFESSIONAL TONE

### FILE 6: src/components/HowItWorks.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è Casual conversational language and platitudes**

#### Change 6.1: Lines 7-23 - Update Steps Array

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 7-23):**
```typescript
const steps = [
  {
    number: 1,
    title: "Understand",
    description: "We learn about your needs, network preferences, and budget.",
  },
  {
    number: 2,
    title: "Compare",
    description: "We compare plans from top carriers and PPO networks.",
  },
  {
    number: 3,
    title: "Enroll",
    description: "Choose confidently and get help with enrollment and next steps.",
  },
];
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
const steps = [
  {
    number: 1,
    title: "Assessment",
    description: "Evaluate coverage needs, budget parameters, and network preferences.",
  },
  {
    number: 2,
    title: "Analysis",
    description: "Compare available plans from A-rated carriers and PPO networks.",
  },
  {
    number: 3,
    title: "Enrollment",
    description: "Professional enrollment support and policy activation assistance.",
  },
];
```

**Why:** Professional nouns vs. casual verbs. Institutional voice vs. "We learn." Removes casual "Choose confidently."

---

#### Change 6.2: Line 44 - Update Section Title

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 44):**
```typescript
How It Works
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Enrollment Process
```

**Why:** More specific, professional terminology

---

#### Change 6.3: Line 53 - Remove Platitude

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 53):**
```typescript
Getting the right insurance coverage shouldn't be complicated. Our simple 3-step process makes it easy.
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Three-step consultation and enrollment process with licensed insurance professionals.
```

**Why:** Removes platitude "shouldn't be complicated" and marketing claim "makes it easy." Direct, factual. 17 words ‚Üí 11 words (35% reduction).

---

#### Change 6.4: Line 122 - Update CTA Button

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 122):**
```typescript
Start Step 1 Now
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Request Consultation
```

**Why:** Professional action vs. imperative command with number reference

---

#### Change 6.5: Line 125 - Update Supporting Text

**SELECT THIS CODE (line 125):**
```typescript
Free consultation ‚Ä¢ No obligation ‚Ä¢ Licensed advisors
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
Licensed professionals ‚Ä¢ Multi-state coverage ‚Ä¢ Year-round enrollment
```

**Why:** Removes defensive "Free" and "No obligation." Highlights actual value props.

---

### FILE 7: src/components/About.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è Vague platitudes and geographic inaccuracy**

#### Change 7.1: Lines 12-14 - Replace Paragraph

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 12-14):**
```typescript
<p className="text-lg">
  Founded on integrity and driven by results, we help clients across the country secure protection they can count on‚Äîwhile delivering the personal service they deserve.
</p>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<p className="text-lg">
  Independent insurance brokerage serving FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, and GA. Licensed professionals specializing in health and life insurance solutions with A-rated carrier partnerships.
</p>
```

**Why:** Removes vague platitudes "integrity," "driven by results," "deserve." Fixes "across the country" to accurate 6 states. Concrete credentials. 28 words ‚Üí 22 words (21% reduction).

---

### FILE 8: src/components/OurCarriers.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è Unverified marketing claims**

#### Change 8.1: Lines 11-14 - Replace Content

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 11-14):**
```typescript
<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Our Trusted Carriers</h2>
<p className="text-lg">
  We partner directly with the nation's top-rated carriers to bring you robust, flexible, and affordable coverage options.
</p>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Carrier Partnerships</h2>
<p className="text-lg">
  Direct appointments with A-rated carriers including Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and additional regional providers.
</p>
```

**Why:** Removes marketing qualifier "Trusted." Removes unverified "nation's top-rated" claim. Removes vague adjectives "robust, flexible, affordable" with specific carrier names. 21 words ‚Üí 18 words (14% reduction).

---

### FILE 9: src/components/luxury/AuthoritySection.tsx

**‚ö†Ô∏è Unverified statistics and credentials**

#### Change 9.1: Lines 9-34 - Update Achievements Array

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 9-34):**
```typescript
const achievements = [
  {
    icon: Award,
    number: "15+",
    label: "Years Experience",
    description: "Industry expertise since 2008"
  },
  {
    icon: Users,
    number: "5,000+",
    label: "Families Served",
    description: "Trusted by thousands nationwide"
  },
  {
    icon: TrendingUp,
    number: "$2.5B",
    label: "Coverage Written",
    description: "Protecting families' financial futures"
  },
  {
    icon: Calendar,
    number: "365",
    label: "Days Support",
    description: "Year-round expert guidance"
  }
];
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
const achievements = [
  {
    icon: Award,
    number: "15+",
    label: "Years Licensed",
    description: "Insurance professionals since 2008"
  },
  {
    icon: Users,
    number: "5,000+",
    label: "Clients Served",
    description: "Multi-state client base"
  },
  {
    icon: TrendingUp,
    number: "$2.5B",
    label: "Coverage Volume",
    description: "Total policy face amounts"
  },
  {
    icon: Calendar,
    number: "6",
    label: "Licensed States",
    description: "FL, MI, NC, AZ, TX, GA"
  }
];
```

**Why:** "Years Licensed" verifiable vs. "Experience." "Clients" vs. "Families" (business too). "Coverage Volume" clearer than "Written." CRITICAL: Last stat changed from "365 Days" to "6 Licensed States" - verifiable concrete fact vs. marketing speak.

---

#### Change 9.2: Lines 36-41 - Update Certifications Array

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 36-41):**
```typescript
const certifications = [
  { name: "Licensed Insurance Agent", code: `NPN ${BRAND.npn}` },
  { name: "Health Insurance Specialist", code: "Certified 2023" },
  { name: "Life Insurance Expert", code: "Advanced Certification" },
  { name: "Customer Service Excellence", code: "5-Star Rating" }
];
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
const certifications = [
  { name: "Licensed Insurance Professional", code: `NPN ${BRAND.npn}` },
  { name: "Health Insurance Appointments", code: "Multi-Carrier" },
  { name: "Life Insurance Appointments", code: "Multi-Carrier" },
  { name: "A-Rated Carrier Partnerships", code: "Direct Appointments" }
];
```

**Why:** Removes unverified "Specialist" and "Expert" titles. Removes unverified "5-Star Rating." Factual appointments and partnerships.

---

#### Change 9.3: Lines 43-48 - Update Awards Array

**SELECT THIS CODE (lines 43-48):**
```typescript
const awards = [
  "BBB A+ Rating",
  "Top Insurance Partner 2023",
  "Customer Choice Award",
  "Excellence in Service"
];
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS:**
```typescript
const awards = [
  "BBB A+ Rating",
  "Licensed in Six States",
  "A-Rated Carrier Partnerships",
  "Year-Round Enrollment Support"
];
```

**Why:** Keeps BBB if verifiable. Replaces unverified awards with concrete facts.

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Codex Doesn't Understand:

Instead of using inline edit:
1. **Manually select** the old code
2. **Delete it**
3. **Paste** the new code directly
4. **Format** with Shift+Alt+F (Windows/Linux) or Shift+Option+F (Mac)

### If You Get Errors:

- Check you didn't accidentally delete surrounding code
