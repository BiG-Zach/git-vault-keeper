# Homepage Content Professionalization - Lovable Dev Implementation

## üéØ Objective
Transform homepage copy from conversational marketing language to professional industry-standard tone. Reduce word count by 50% while eliminating legally problematic language and maintaining all key information.

---

## üö® Critical Rules

### Must Follow
- ‚úÖ **TEXT ONLY** - Change only text content, never layout/structure/styling
- ‚úÖ **NO DESKTOP CHANGES** - Desktop layouts (‚â•768px) remain untouched
- ‚úÖ **PRESERVE STRUCTURE** - Keep all className, props, imports, component hierarchy
- ‚úÖ **LEGAL COMPLIANCE** - Remove ALL personal guarantees, first-person liability language

### Must Remove
- ‚ùå Personal guarantees: "I guarantee," "my promise," "money back"
- ‚ùå First-person: "I," "my," "me" (use institutional voice)
- ‚ùå Emotional appeals: "truly," "deserve," "peace of mind"
- ‚ùå Defensive language: "no hidden fees," "no pressure," "no obligation"
- ‚ùå Imperatives: "Stop overpaying," "Get your quote now"
- ‚ùå Over-qualifiers: "completely free," "absolutely," "really"
- ‚ùå Dramatic punctuation: "Period." at sentence end

### Must Adopt
- ‚úÖ Declarative professional tone
- ‚úÖ Third-person institutional voice
- ‚úÖ Specific, verifiable claims only
- ‚úÖ Professional insurance terminology
- ‚úÖ Parallel sentence structures
