```markdown
INSTEAD OF: Adding new sections/components
APPROACH: Enhance existing components with strategic improvements

EXAMPLE - Carriers Page Hero Enhancement:
OLD CODE:
<PageHero 
  title="Insurance Carriers" 
  subtitle="Access to top-rated insurance carriers"
/>

NEW CODE:  
<PageHero 
  title="Insurance Carriers" 
  subtitle="Access to 15+ A-rated carriers across Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Texas"
/>
