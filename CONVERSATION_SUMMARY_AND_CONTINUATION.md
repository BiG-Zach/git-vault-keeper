## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM CONVERSATION

1. **User wants strategy, not full copy** - Phase 1 is the blueprint, Phase 2 is full content development

2. **Multi-state focus is critical** - Cannot overemphasize Tampa; must appeal to all 6 states

3. **Trust signals have measurable ROI** - Use conversion lift percentages to prioritize

4. **Subphases make it manageable** - Break large strategy into executable chunks

5. **Codex execution is the goal** - Document must be clear enough for VS Code Codex to implement

6. **Context was getting too large** - User felt overwhelmed, requested fresh start with summary

7. **Homepage is the gold standard** - Other pages must match homepage's authority and trustworthiness

---

## ⚠️ AVOID THESE MISTAKES

1. ❌ Writing full copy in Phase 1 (just outlines and structure)
2. ❌ Creating Florida-centric messaging (must be multi-state)
3. ❌ Ignoring conversion lift data (use percentages from research)
4. ❌ Making document too complex (Codex must execute easily)
5. ❌ Forgetting ADA compliance (accessibility is non-negotiable)
6. ❌ Skipping user journey mapping (pages must connect logically)
7. ❌ Overloading with too much at once (subphases exist for a reason)
