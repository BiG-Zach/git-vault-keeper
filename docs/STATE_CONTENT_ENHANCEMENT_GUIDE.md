---

## Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Update State Metadata

Edit [`src/utils/stateMetadata.ts`](../src/utils/stateMetadata.ts):

```typescript
ca: {
  name: 'California',
  available: true,  // ← Add this line
  seo: {
    title: 'California Health & Life Insurance | Bradford Informed Guidance',
    description: 'Licensed California insurance broker. Expert guidance on health & life insurance with instant quotes and personalized recommendations.',
    keywords: kw([
      'California health insurance broker',
      'California life insurance quotes',
      'CA insurance agent',
      'California insurance guidance',
      'Los Angeles insurance advisor',
      'California PPO plans',
      'California insurance expert'
    ]),
  },
},
```

### Step 2: Add State-Specific Content

The content goes in the [`ActiveStateTemplate`](../src/pages/states/[code].tsx:85) component. Currently, it uses generic content. For enhanced states, you may want to:

1. Create state-specific content files in `src/data/states/`
2. Import and use in the template
3. Or modify the template to accept state-specific props

**Example structure:**
```typescript
// src/data/states/california.ts
export const californiaContent = {
  overview: "California has the largest insurance market...",
  regulations: "The California Department of Insurance...",
  carriers: ["Blue Shield of California", "Kaiser Permanente", ...],
  costs: { metro: 450, rural: 380 },
  faqs: [
    { question: "...", answer: "..." },
    // ...
  ]
};
```

### Step 3: Regenerate Sitemap

```bash
node scripts/generate-sitemap.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
Generated sitemap with 36 URLs at /home/zacht/code/git-vault-keeper/public/sitemap.xml
```

### Step 4: Verify Changes

1. **Check sitemap includes new state:**
```bash
grep "states/ca" public/sitemap.xml
```

2. **Test page locally:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173/states/ca
```

3. **Verify meta tags:**
- View page source
- Check for `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`
- Verify title and description

### Step 5: Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: enhance California state page with full content"
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Submit to Google Search Console

1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Navigate to Sitemaps
3. Submit updated sitemap URL
4. Monitor indexing status over next 2 weeks
