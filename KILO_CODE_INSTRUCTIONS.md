# 🚀 KILO CODE READY-TO-USE PROMPT

## ✅ YES! You Can Copy & Paste - But Use This File

I've extracted the **corrected prompt ONLY** into a clean, ready-to-use file for you.

---

## 📁 THE FILE YOU NEED

```
📄 READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md  ← COPY THIS INTO KILO CODE
```

**Size:** 393 lines  
**Content:** Corrected prompt with all fixes applied  
**Ready for:** Direct copy/paste into Kilo Code

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DON'T Use These Files

❌ **PROMPT_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md** - Contains analysis + corrected prompt (too much)  
❌ **PROMPT_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary (reference only)  
❌ **PROMPT_FIXES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick fixes guide (reference only)  
❌ **PROMPT_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Pre-execution checklist (use before running)

✅ **READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md** - THIS IS WHAT YOU COPY TO KILO CODE

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Before Copying to Kilo Code
```bash
# 1. Upload your media files to AI Drive first
# You need these files in /mnt/aidrive/:
- The_Financial_Protection_Paradox__Record_Premiums,_100_Million_.m4a
- Demystifying_Life_Insurance.mp4

# 2. Verify they're uploaded
ls -la /mnt/aidrive/
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** If these files aren't in `/mnt/aidrive/`, the prompt will note they're missing and skip the file copy steps (it won't break, but you won't get multimedia).

---

### Step 2: Copy the Prompt
```bash
# Open the file
cat READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md

# OR view in editor
code READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md

# Then: Select all → Copy
```

---

### Step 3: Paste into Kilo Code
1. Open Kilo Code in VS Code
2. Paste the entire contents of `READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md`
3. Hit Enter/Send

---

### Step 4: What Claude Will Do

Claude (via Kilo Code) will automatically:

1. ✅ Verify working directory and project structure
2. ✅ Check if AI Drive files exist
3. ✅ Create `/public/media/audio/` and `/public/media/video/` directories
4. ✅ Copy media files from AI Drive (if present)
5. ✅ Convert audio to MP3 fallback
6. ✅ Optimize video for web
7. ✅ Create `MultimediaOverview.tsx` component
8. ✅ Create `faqSchema.ts` utility
9. ✅ Update article metadata (title, date, description)
10. ✅ Add multimedia section to article
11. ✅ Add 2025 market statistics sections
12. ✅ Add FAQ schema markup
13. ✅ Add 5 internal links
14. ✅ Run type checking and linting
15. ✅ Create Git commit with descriptive message
16. ✅ Provide validation instructions

---

## 🎨 What's Different from Your Original Prompt

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **HTML → JSX** - All syntax converted to React
2. ✅ **AI Drive Path** - `/aidrive/` → `/mnt/aidrive/`
3. ✅ **Asset Paths** - Using `/media/` structure
4. ✅ **Schema Implementation** - Component-based approach
5. ✅ **File Format** - React component variables, not frontmatter
6. ✅ **Internal Links** - React Router `<Link>` components
7. ✅ **Component Extraction** - Multimedia section as reusable component
8. ✅ **Mobile CSS** - Tailwind responsive classes

### Kept from Original:
- ✅ All your excellent content strategy
- ✅ SEO approach and keyword targeting
- ✅ Market statistics and data
- ✅ Git commit message structure
- ✅ Validation and testing steps

## 📋 Pre-Execution Checklist

Before pasting into Kilo Code, verify:

- [ ] Media files uploaded to `/mnt/aidrive/`
- [ ] Target article exists: `src/pages/blog/TermVsWholeLifeInsurance2024.tsx`
- [ ] You're in the correct directory: `/home/user/webapp`
- [ ] Git branch is correct (main or your working branch)
- [ ] You have a backup if needed (Claude will suggest this)

**If all checked ✅, you're ready to paste into Kilo Code!**

---

## 🚨 What If Media Files Are Missing?

No problem! The prompt includes checks:

```bash
# The prompt will:
1. Check if files exist in /mnt/aidrive/
2. If missing: Display warning + skip file operations
3. If present: Copy and optimize them
```

You can still run the prompt without media files - you'll get all the content updates, just not the multimedia section. You can add that later after uploading the files.

---

## 🎯 Expected Execution Time

With Kilo Code + Claude Sonnet 4.5:
- **Verification:** 30 seconds
- **File operations:** 1-2 minutes (if media files present)
- **Component creation:** 1 minute
- **Content updates:** 2-3 minutes
- **Testing/validation:** 1 minute

**Total:** ~5-8 minutes for complete execution

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
1. ✅ No TypeScript errors
2. ✅ No ESLint errors
3. ✅ New files created:
   - `src/components/blog/MultimediaOverview.tsx`
   - `src/utils/faqSchema.ts`
   - `public/media/audio/` (with files)
   - `public/media/video/` (with file)
4. ✅ Article updated with 2025 content
5. ✅ Git commit created
6. ✅ Dev server runs without errors

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Claude says "Media files not found"
**Cause:** Files not in `/mnt/aidrive/`  
**Solution:** Upload files, then run prompt again OR continue without multimedia

### If you get TypeScript errors
**Cause:** Import paths might need adjustment  
**Solution:** Claude will suggest fixes, or check import statements

### If assets 404 in browser
**Cause:** Path mismatch  
**Solution:** Verify paths in component are `/media/audio/` not `/assets/audio/`
