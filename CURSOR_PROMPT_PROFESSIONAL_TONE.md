## Verification

After making these changes, verify:

1. âœ… All casual titles replaced with professional equivalents
2. âœ… All "we" statements converted to institutional voice
3. âœ… No defensive language ("no obligation," "free")
4. âœ… No emotional appeals ("truly understand," "deserve")
5. âœ… Specific carriers named instead of vague claims
6. âœ… Concrete facts instead of marketing adjectives
7. âœ… Statistics clarified with proper labels
8. âœ… Last achievement changed to "6 Licensed States"

**Impact**: These changes improve professional credibility and reduce word count by approximately 40-50% across these sections.
